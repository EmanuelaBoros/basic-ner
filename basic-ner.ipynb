    "## **Fine-tuning BERT for named-entity recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to use [**AutoModelForTokenClassification**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForTokenClassification) which is included in the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by HuggingFace. This model has a Transformer as its base architecture, with a token classification head on top, allowing it to make predictions at the token level, rather than the sequence level. **Named entity recognition (NER)** is typically treated as a token classification problem, so that's what we are going to use it for.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the idea of **transfer learning**, i.e. first pretraining a large neural network in an unsupervised way, and then fine-tuning that neural network on a task of interest. In this case, BERT is a neural network pretrained on t tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. Now, we are going to fine-tune this network on a NER dataset. Fine-tuning is supervised learning, so this means we will need a labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about BERT, I suggest the following resources:\n",
    "* the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\n",

    "#### **Downloading and preprocessing the data**\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) uses a specific annotation scheme, which is defined (at least for European languages) at the *word* level. An annotation scheme that is widely used is called **[IOB-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)**, which stands for Inside-Outside-Beginning. Each tag indicates whether the corresponding word is *inside*, *outside* or at the *beginning* of a specific named entity. The reason this is used is because named entities usually comprise more than 1 word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example. If you have a sentence like \"Barack Obama was born in Hawaï\", then the corresponding tags would be   [B-PERS, I-PERS, O, O, O, B-GEO]. B-PERS means that the word \"Barack\" is the beginning of a person, I-PERS means that the word \"Obama\" is inside a person, \"O\" means that the word \"was\" is outside a named entity, and so on. So one typically has as many tags as there are words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you want to train a deep learning model for NER, it requires that you have your data in this IOB format (or similar formats such as [BILOU](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116446/what-do-the-bilou-tags-mean-in-named-entity-recognition)). There exist many annotation tools which let you create these kind of annotations automatically (such as Spacy's [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Tagtog](https://docs.tagtog.net/) or [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)). You can also use Spacy's [biluo_tags_from_offsets](https://spacy.io/api/goldparse#biluo_tags_from_offsets) function to convert annotations at the character level to IOB format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use [HIPE](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data) that is already in IOB format. Uncomment to clone it in the same folder."

    "A tricky part of NER with BERT is that BERT relies on **wordpiece tokenization**, rather than word tokenization. This means that we should also define the labels at the wordpiece-level, rather than the word-level!\n",

    "For example, if you have word like \"Washington\" which is labeled as \"B-GPE\", but it gets tokenized to \"Wash\", \"##ing\", \"##ton\", then one approach could be to handle this by only train the model on the tag labels for the first word piece token of a word (i.e. only label \"Wash\" with \"B-GPE\"). This is what was done in the original BERT paper, see Github discussion [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/64#issuecomment-443703063).\n",

This was done in [this NER tutorial with BERT](https://github.com/chambliss/Multilingual_NER/blob/master/python/utils/main_utils.py#L118). Another design decision could be to give the first wordpiece of each word the original word label, and then use the label “X” for all subsequent subwords of that word.

    "#### **Training the BERT Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the model, let's perform a sanity check, which I learned thanks to Andrej Karpathy's wonderful [cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford (see also his [blog post about debugging neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)). The initial loss of your model should be close to -ln(1/number of classes) = -ln(1/17) = 2.83.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because we are using cross entropy loss. The cross entropy loss is defined as -ln(probability score of the model for the correct class). In the beginning, the weights are random, so the probability distribution for all of the classes for a given token will be uniform, meaning that the probability for the correct class will be near 1/17. The loss for a given token will thus be -ln(1/17). As PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) (which is used by `BertForTokenClassification`) uses *mean reduction* by default, it will compute the mean loss for each of the tokens in the sequence for which a label is provided.\n",

    "Let's verify this:\n",
